Assessment 1
I created a VPC with CIDR range of "10.0.0.0/16" and i split it into four subents 2 public and 2 private. 
Then i created a Route Table for public and private traffic. 
The public subents are connected to a IGW gateway to access internet directly and the private subnet is connected to a NAT gateway.
CIDR range for VPC- 10.0.0.0/16
subnet(public-a)- 10.0.1.0/24 
subnet(public-b)- 10.0.2.0/24
subnet(private-a) - 10.0.4.0/24
subnet(private-b) - 10.0.5.0/24
