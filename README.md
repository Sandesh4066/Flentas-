Assessment 1
I created a VPC with CIDR range of "10.0.0.0/16" and i split it into four subents 2 public and 2 private. 
Then i created a Route Table for public and private traffic. 
The public subents are connected to a IGW gateway to access internet directly and the private subnet is connected to a NAT gateway.
